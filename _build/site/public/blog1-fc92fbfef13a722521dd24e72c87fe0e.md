The stock market can look like a wild ocean — prices go up, crash down, and leave most people wondering, “When should I buy? When should I sell?”
But what if the answer is already right there on the chart — hidden inside two small lines?

Yes, really.
You can learn to read what these lines are saying and make calm, confident decisions without guessing or panicking.

The Story of the Two Lines
Every stock chart has something called EMAs, or Exponential Moving Averages.
Think of them as two friends always following the price. One walks fast, the other walks slowly.

The fast friend (called EMA 5) is quick — it reacts to every move the price makes.

The slow friend (called EMA 13) moves calmly — it doesn’t rush, it waits to be sure.

Now watch them on a chart.
When the fast friend runs ahead of the slow one, it usually means excitement — buyers are stepping in and pushing the price up.
That’s your first signal to buy — the market may be starting to rise.

But when the fast friend gets tired and falls behind, it means sellers have taken control — the price could be turning down.
That’s your clue to sell — or stay out until things calm down.

The moment when these two lines cross is like a whisper from the market saying, “Something’s changing.”

Reading What the Candles Say
Now that you know about the crossing, here’s one extra thing the best traders always check — the candle.

Each candle on your chart shows how the price moved during a specific time period.
If it’s green, the price closed higher — a good sign for buyers.
If it’s red, the price closed lower — a sign of weakness.

When you see a green candle appear right after the fast line crosses above the slow one, the message is clear: the stock wants to go up.
That’s a good time to buy.

If a red candle shows up when the fast line drops below the slow one, it means sellers are stronger.
It’s time to sell or avoid buying until the trend changes again.

Follow the Bigger Mood of the Market
Sometimes, the market can trick you — a stock can move a little up even though the whole market is falling.
To avoid such traps, there’s another helper on the chart called the 200 EMA — the long-term trend line.

It’s like a weather forecast for the whole market:

If the price is above this line, the sky is clear — the market is happy — so you look for buying opportunities.

If the price is below it, it’s cloudy and stormy — the market is weak — better to focus on selling or waiting for recovery.

This way, you’re always moving with the market, not against it.

Protecting Yourself — The Smart Safety Net
Even when everything looks perfect, prices can surprise us. That’s why professionals never trade without a safety shield called a Stop Loss.

It simply means you decide in advance how much loss you can take, and if the stock falls beyond that point, you automatically exit.

To decide where to place it, we use something called ATR (Average True Range) — a tool that measures how much a stock usually moves up or down.

If a stock usually moves ₹10 a day, that’s its ATR.
A good stop-loss level is 1.5× ATR, which gives the trade enough space to breathe without letting it run too far against you.

So if you buy a stock at ₹100 and its ATR is ₹10, putting your stop at ₹85 keeps you safe from wild market swings.

When to Take Your Profit
The market will not rise forever.
When the price has moved nicely in your favor — about three times what you risked — that’s the perfect time to take your profit.

If you risked ₹10, target ₹30 profit.
That way, even a few good trades can cover one bad one.
It’s simple math, but it keeps your emotions under control and your results consistent.

Listening to the Crowd — Why Volume Matters
Every rally needs a crowd.
When the stock starts moving with a lot of volume — meaning more people are trading than usual — it shows power and belief behind the move.

If volume is high, your signal is strong.
If volume is weak, it’s like shouting in an empty room — there’s no energy to push the price far.

So before any trade, just make sure the volume bar is louder than normal. That’s when you know the move is real.

The Simple Truth
If you piece everything together, the whole system becomes incredibly straightforward:

When the fast line rises above the slow line, and you see a green candle, with strong volume, and the price is above the big 200 line, it’s time to buy — the market is heading up.
When the fast line drops below the slow line, the candle turns red, the volume is high, and the price is under the 200 line, it’s time to sell — the market is moving down.

And if the price moves too far in the wrong direction? Don’t worry — your stop loss takes care of that.
If it moves in your favor, your profit target locks in the win.

In the End
You don’t need to predict the market.
Just listen to what it’s already saying through these simple clues — two lines, one candle, a bit of volume, and a safety plan.

When the chart shows strength, buy confidently.
When it shows weakness, step aside or sell early.
Always follow the bigger flow, and always protect your capital.
