This strategy belongs to a style called mean reversion scalping. Instead of trying to ride long trends, it tries to:

Buy when price has fallen too fast and looks exhausted.

Sell when price has climbed too fast and looks exhausted.

To do that, it uses two main tools working together:

RSI with a very short length (7)
This is like a “pressure gauge” that tells how intense recent buying or selling has been.

If RSI is around 85 or higher, it suggests the market is overbought – buyers might be overdoing it.

If RSI is around 15 or lower, it suggests the market is oversold – sellers might be overdoing it.

Reversal candlestick patterns
The strategy does not trust RSI alone. It waits for price to actually show signs of turning. It looks for things like:

Engulfing candles – a strong candle that completely covers the previous one’s body, hinting at a sharp power shift.

Hammer or Shooting Star–type candles – candles with long wicks showing rejection of lower (for hammers) or higher (for shooting stars) prices.

Two candles in a row in the new direction after an RSI extreme.

Only when RSI is at an extreme and the candles show a clear reversal pattern does the strategy mark a buy or sell opportunity. That combination is what gives it its “high confluence” feel.

What this approach does well and where it struggles
There are some genuine strengths here:

It does not fire on every bump in price. It waits for very stretched RSI levels (15/85) plus a clear reversal-type candle. That cuts out a lot of noise and weak signals.

The RSI(7) is very quick to react, which is ideal for lower timeframes like 1-minute or 5-minute charts where gold and other liquid markets move rapidly.

The logic is flexible: you can turn some patterns on or off depending on how choppy or clean the market is.

But there are also important limits:

In a strong trend, RSI can stay overbought or oversold for a long time while price keeps pushing in the same direction. In those cases, trying to fade every extreme can be painful.

The original logic is mostly about entries. It does not fully define:

Where exactly you should get out if the trade goes against you.

Where you should take profits when it goes in your favor.

Fixed RSI levels like 85/15 can be too rigid:

You might miss good reversals that happen at more common levels like 70/30.

During very volatile periods, even 85/15 can trigger too soon, before the move is truly exhausted.

So think of it as a strong “spotter” for potential turning points, but it needs more structure around risk and exits to be truly robust.

How to make this more robust and “smarter”
To turn this from a clever idea into a more professional-grade tool, a few upgrades make a big difference:

Let RSI adapt to volatility
Instead of always using fixed numbers like 85 and 15, you can put something like a volatility band around RSI itself. The overbought/oversold lines can widen when the market is wild and tighten when it’s calm, so you are not jumping in too early during big moves.

Use volatility-based stop losses
Rather than using a fixed number of points or dollars as a stop, the logic can use Average True Range (ATR) as a volatility measure. A common approach is:

Place your stop loss roughly 1.0–1.5 × ATR beyond the extreme of the signal candle (below the low for longs, above the high for shorts).
This keeps the stop far enough away that normal noise does not kick you out, but close enough to define your risk clearly.

Add a simple trend filter
Fading every extreme in a strong trend is dangerous. A basic way to avoid that is to look at a 200-period moving average:

Only take buy scalps if price is above this long-term average (overall uptrend).

Only take sell scalps if price is below it (overall downtrend).
That way you are usually fading pullbacks inside a bigger trend, not fighting the trend itself.

Define exits clearly
A clean exit plan might look like:

Stop loss just beyond the signal candle’s extreme by about 1 × ATR.

Take profit at about 2 × your initial risk, or when RSI returns toward the middle around 50, which often signals that the “snap-back” you were targeting has played out.

With these additions, you have not only a way to spot potential reversals, but also a clear plan for how to enter, protect, and exit.

The simple logic in everyday language
If you explain this strategy to someone without technical background, it sounds like this:

You watch for times when the market has pushed too far in one direction.

Your RSI gauge tells you when buying or selling has been extremely strong.

You then wait for the candles themselves to show that the move is weakening and reversing.

Once you see:

Extreme RSI, and

A strong reversal candle pattern, and

Ideally, price moving in line with the bigger trend,
you take a quick trade in the opposite direction, aiming to profit from the snap-back.

If the market does not snap back and instead continues against you, your stop loss gets you out before the loss becomes too big. If it moves your way, your target or the RSI coming back to normal helps you lock in profits instead of overstaying.

What this means for someone trading gold or similar markets
For someone trading very liquid markets like gold on short timeframes, this strategy offers:

A structured way to buy dips and sell spikes instead of guessing.

Clear conditions for when a move looks overdone and likely to bounce or pull back.

A framework to attach proper risk control and profit-taking around those entries.
